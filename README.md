# demo-app-int-gemini

## Setup Instructions

Update config variables under dev folder and update config variables in the setup-integration.sh script.
Use the apply command from this script to apply it to your project.

## Description

This integration provides a simplification of the Vertex/Gemini interface so you can ingest GenAI features into your integration flows - summarization, generation, classification, etc.

This integration really only makes sense to be run synchronously - as one invoking Gemini would expect its answer. It is also thought to be mainly used as a sub-integration via its Private Trigger but a regular API Trigger was provided for convenience.

Inputs - the only mandatory input is prompt. Temperature (0), model-name (gemini-1.5-flash), maxOutputTokens (2048) can be set, but have default values. GoogleSearchGrounding can be set by simply sending a boolean value (default is false) It also supports multimodal - so image/video can be analyzed by pointing to the GCS bucket address and providing a mimeType.

Output - the text generated by Gemini.
